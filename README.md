# Sha3-Brute-Force

Hello!

This was created to solve the Capture the Ether problem, "Guess the secret number".
https://capturetheether.com/challenges/lotteries/guess-the-secret-number/

It hashes all uint8 values with Sha3/Keccak256 in the same way that Solidity would. It then compares the output to the hashed value of the "secret number" from the problem.

It's a brute-force attack but runs very quickly!

I hope you enjoy,

Dante
